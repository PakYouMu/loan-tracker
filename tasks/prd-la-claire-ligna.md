# Product Requirements Document (PRD): La Claire Ligna (Loan Tracker)

## 1. Introduction/Overview
**La Claire Ligna** is a comprehensive, full-stack financial tracking application designed to manage both capital funds and active loan portfolios. It solves the critical problem of decentralized, erroneous spreadsheet accounting for lenders by providing a robust, ledger-backed mathematical engine wrapped in a premium, highly responsive user interface. 

This document serves as primary onboarding material for new developers, a baseline for future feature expansions, a stakeholder record of the current architecture, and a functional reference for potential future mobile application ports.

## 2. Goals
- **Financial Accuracy:** Provide a mathematically flawless engine for calculating loan amortizations, interest accruals, and remaining balances.
- **Dual-Sided Management:** Enable lenders to manage their top-level Capital (Funds, Deposits, Withdrawals) in sync with their lower-level Assets (Loan Disbursements, Repayments).
- **Data Integrity:** Ensure that all financial actions (creating, paying, or voiding loans) are strictly recorded and reversible via an immutable double-entry ledger system.
- **Premium UX:** Deliver a state-of-the-art, responsive interface featuring dynamic dark/light modes, 3D interactive canvases, and seamless CSS-driven transitions.

## 3. User Stories
### Target Audience
Individual private lenders managing personal networks and small-to-medium lending businesses managing capital funds and borrower portfolios.

### Key Stories
- **As a Fund Manager**, I want to create distinct "Funds" to separate different pools of capital (e.g., "Family Fund", "High Risk Fund").
- **As a Lender**, I want to deposit or withdraw capital from my Funds, and see my "Cash on Hand" dynamically update based on how much money is currently lent out versus how much is sitting in the bank.
- **As a Lender**, I want to create a new borrower profile and seamlessly disburse a loan to them, with the system automatically generating a bi-monthly payment schedule based on the principal, interest rate, and duration.
- **As a Lender**, I want to record partial or full payments against specific schedule dates, and see the borrower's remaining balance update instantly.
- **As an Admin**, I want to be able to "Void" a loan made in error. This should reverse the financial footprint (restoring my cash-on-hand) but keep the voided loan record visible for auditing purposes.

## 4. Functional Requirements
### 4.1. Capital & Ledger System
1. The system must support creating, reading, updating, and deleting isolated "Funds".
2. The system must track all money movement through a specialized `ledger` table (categories: `DEPOSIT`, `WITHDRAWAL`, `LOAN_DISBURSEMENT`, `LOAN_REPAYMENT`, `ADJUSTMENT`).
3. "Cash on Hand" mathematically equals `(Total Deposits - Total Withdrawals) + (Total Repayments - Total Disbursements)`. This must be calculated dynamically via database views.

### 4.2. Loan & Borrower Management
4. The system must allow creating Borrower profiles (Name, Contact info).
5. The system must allow creating Loans attached to a Borrower and a Fund, requiring Principal, Interest Rate (flat/simple), and Duration in months.
6. Upon Loan creation, the system must trigger a `LOAN_DISBURSEMENT` ledger entry subtracting the principal from the fund's Cash on Hand.
7. The system must automatically generate a `payment_schedule` with due dates (typically the 15th and end of the month) outlining the amortized amounts expected.

### 4.3. Payment Processing & Rollbacks
8. The system must allow users to log monetary payments against specific pending schedule items.
9. Logging a payment must trigger a `LOAN_REPAYMENT` ledger entry, increasing the fund's Cash on Hand.
10. The system must allow users to delete payments, which must hard-delete the corresponding ledger entry to reverse the Cash on Hand.
11. The system must allow "Voiding" a loan (soft-deleting the loan record, hard-deleting the initial disbursement ledger, soft-deleting all related payments, and hard-deleting all related repayment ledgers).

### 4.4. UI/UX & Authentication
12. The system must enforce secure authentication via Supabase Auth (Email/Password).
13. The UX must natively support both Light and Dark mode themes.
14. Auth pages must feature responsive WebGL interactive backgrounds and mathematical color inversion (via CSS `mix-blend-mode` or responsive `clip-path` masks).
15. The UI must utilize toast notifications for robust error handling and success feedback.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- **Complex Compounding Interest:** The current mathematical engine is designed for simple, flat-rate interest amortized evenly over the duration. Daily compounding interest is out of scope.
- **Automated Payment Processing:** The system tracks payments manually entered by the lender. It does not integrate with Stripe/Plaid to automatically pull funds from borrower bank accounts.
- **Borrower Portals:** The system is an internal tool for the Lender only. There is no exterior login portal for the borrowers themselves to check their balances.

## 6. Design Considerations
- **Component Architecture:** Built extensively on Radix UI primitives via Shadcn UI components.
- **Interactive Backgrounds:** Utilizes `Three.js` and custom GLSL shaders for performant 60FPS fluid backgrounds on landing and auth pages, wrapped in Next.js Contexts to manage motion preferences.
- **Responsive Layout:** Heavy emphasis on mobile usability, utilizing Tailwind breakpoints (`md:`, `lg:`) to reflow data tables into card-based layouts and shift multi-axis CSS masks.

## 7. Technical Considerations
- **Stack:** Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase (PostgreSQL).
- **Database Logic:** Relies heavily on Supabase SQL Triggers (e.g., `handle_new_loan` to inject ledgers, `handle_loan_update` to regenerate schedules) and SQL Views (e.g., `view_wallet_balance`, `view_loan_summary`) to guarantee data integrity over client-side math.
- **Auth Strategy:** Supabase SSR (Server-Side Rendering) middleware is used to protect routes and ensure active sessions before page loads.

## 8. Success Metrics
- 100% mathematical parity between the sum of the `ledger` table and the visually reported "Cash on Hand".
- Zero orphaned `payment_schedule` entries upon loan deletion or voiding.
- UI responds within `< 100ms` for critical actions (Payment logging, Capital adjustment) leveraging Optimistic UI updates where possible.

## 9. Open Questions
1. **Pagination:** As the `ledger` and `payments` tables grow, at what threshold should infinite-scroll or explicit pagination be implemented to protect dashboard load times?
2. **Multi-Tenancy:** Currently, authentication is singular. If this app scales to multiple independent lending businesses, a Row Level Security (RLS) paradigm shifting to `organization_id` policies will be required.
