Welcome to **La Claire Ligña**, a premium alternative to messy spreadsheet accounting. Built specifically for private lenders and small lending businesses, this application acts as your central financial hub. Manage high-level capital funds and track granular loan disbursements, all backed by a reversible double-entry ledger that guarantees mathematical perfection down to the final cent.

## Why La Claire Ligña?

- **Immutable Financial Integrity**: Forget broken spreadsheet formulas. Every loan, payment, and deletion is written securely into an append-tracking ledger (deposits, disbursements, repayments), guaranteeing your Cash-on-Hand perfectly matches reality.
- **Automated Amortization**: Provide a principal, flat interest rate, and duration, and the system instantly maps out bi-monthly schedule payments bridging the entire loan lifecycle.
- **Fluid & Modern UX**: Built with Shadcn UI, pure CSS animations, and Three.js 60FPS fluid backgrounds, the entire application feels like a native mobile app, functioning beautifully in both Light and Dark modes.
- **Auditable Rollbacks**: Need to void a bad loan? The system safely restores your initial cash disbursement while retaining the voided record for transparent historical auditing.
- **AI-Powered OCR**: Skip manual entry. Capture photos of borrower IDs and documents to automatically populate profiles with precision, streamlining your onboarding workflow.

## Key Features

*   **Multi-Fund Management:** Segment your capital. Move money in and out of discrete funds.
*   **Dual-Sided Balances:** Watch your active cash-on-hand deplete as you distribute loans, and refill as borrowers submit payments.
*   **Intelligent Schedule Grids:** Visual dashboards reveal exactly how much is expected on upcoming 15th and end-of-month cycles.
*   **QR & OCR Ready:** Generate scannable QR portfolios and track ID-driven borrower interactions.
*   **Next-Gen Tech Stack:** Powered end-to-end by Next.js Server Actions, PostgreSQL (Supabase), and Tailwind CSS.
